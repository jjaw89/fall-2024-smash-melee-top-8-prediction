    "## Loading SQLite Database into Pandas DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code connects to an SQLite database (`melee_player_database.db`) and converts each table within the database into a pandas DataFrame. The DataFrames will be stored in a dictionary, where each key corresponds to the table name with `_df` appended, and the values are the respective DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database Connection**: We use the `sqlite3` library to connect to the SQLite database file.\n",
    "2. **Retrieve Table Names**: A query retrieves all the table names in the database.\n",
    "3. **Convert Tables to DataFrames**: For each table:\n",
    "   - The table is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_sql()`.\n",
    "   - We check each column to see if any data is JSON-formatted (lists or dictionaries). If so, we convert these columns from strings into their corresponding Python objects using `json.loads()`.\n",
    "4. **Store DataFrames**: The DataFrames are stored in a dictionary, where the key is the table name with a `_df` suffix, and the value is the DataFrame.\n",
    "5. **Database Connection Closed**: Once all tables are loaded into DataFrames, the database connection is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "If the database contains a table named `players`, the corresponding DataFrame will be stored in the dictionary with the key `players_df`, and can be accessed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
