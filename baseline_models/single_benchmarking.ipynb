With it, ELO scores appear to (mostly) follow a multivariate normal distribution, while lower-quality data tends to cluster far more around the default elo values of 1500. This suggests, at least in the case of high-quality data, that very simplistic linear models might actually yield the best performance."

    "Before we begin, some important remarks are in order. In some sense, this is time series data, and in another sense, it is not. It somewhat showcases the evolution of player ELO ratings (and related features) over time, albeit without directly linking them to certain players. However, these ELO scores, in some sense, already take into account all of the player's past performance up to a certain point. Likewise, RD values are meant to indicate the \"uncertainty\" in any player's current ELO score, and at any one point in time it takes into account all of their previous games, and even how long it has been since they've last played.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, it is somewhat ill-advised to shuffle the data when training. Especially for more advanced models, it might potentially be able to recognize that a very precise ELO score has shown up in some future match, and conclude that it must have won some previous matches (note that we have updated ELO scores only once a week).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we begin by training some basic models that have the goal of predicting the outcome of individual sets, with no ability to look back on any past performance (single-set models). We first want to observe the impact of the following factors, and are not yet interested in serious hyperparameter tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is it better to only train on more recent data rather than all data up to a certain point (perhaps game meta, average ELO, etc... shifts over time)\n",
    "* Are we actually gaining anything by including all of our engineered ELO scores, rather than just the default ones?\n",
    "* What is the impact of considering only on \"high quality\" data which has received many updates to all ELO scores?\n",
    "\n",
    "We also note that for this single-set predictor, we train on data up to 2022 (and test on 2023) for cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. The secondary model which takes tournament performance into account (which will use this single-set model), tuned on 2023 data and have its final performance tested on 2024 data. However, for the interest of obtaining a final performance score for the single-set predictor, it should be safely testable on 2024 data as well."
